   Scraping personal data from other users, including but not limited to email addresses, interests, or location data, without explicit consent, violates Swedish **Data Protection Laws**. It also contravenes the **GDPR**, which protects individuals’ personal information from unauthorized access.

**Example 2: Impersonating Another Person or Entity for the Purpose of Fraud or Harassment**  
   Using fake identities to defraud other users or commit harassment is a violation of Swedish **criminal law** under fraud (Brottsbalken 9:1), and harassment (Brottsbalken 4:7). Impersonating another individual for malicious purposes, such as gaining access to private information or committing identity theft, is subject to criminal prosecution.

**Example 3: Posting Advertisements for Services Unrelated to the Intent of the Platform**  
   Using the Platform to promote unrelated services such as financial schemes, non-dating products, or unrelated social causes, in a manner that could be seen as spam, violates **Swedish E-commerce Laws**. This also breaches **GDPR** when personal data is misused for marketing purposes without proper consent.

**Example 4: Engaging in Harassment or Bullying**  
   Harassing or bullying other users, including sending repeated unwanted messages or creating profiles to target individuals with hateful or offensive content, is prohibited. This behavior is a violation of both **Swedish criminal law** (Brottsbalken 4:7) and the **Discrimination Act** (Diskrimineringslagen) that prohibits harassment in digital spaces.

**Example 5: Distributing Malicious Software**  
   Uploading, distributing, or attempting to introduce viruses, malware, or spyware onto the Platform to compromise its security or disrupt other users’ experience is a violation of **Swedish cybercrime laws**. This could lead to charges under **the Swedish Penal Code** related to unauthorized data interference and destruction.

**Example 6: Exploiting Platform Vulnerabilities for Unauthorized Access**  
   Attempting to hack, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to the Platform or its database through techniques such as SQL injection or phishing attacks is prohibited by Swedish **cybersecurity laws**. Such actions are illegal under both the **Electronic Communications Act** and the **Swedish Penal Code**.

#### 7.3 **Consequences of Violation**

Violations of this Acceptable Use Policy may result in a range of consequences, depending on the severity of the violation. These may include:

1. **Suspension or Termination of Your Account**:  
   Ember reserves the right to suspend or terminate your account if you are found to violate this Acceptable Use Policy. The suspension may be temporary, such as when investigating a potential violation, or permanent if the violation is deemed severe, such as engaging in fraudulent activity or violating laws related to personal data.

   - **Example 1**: If you are found to have impersonated another user or engaged in fraudulent activities, Ember will suspend your account immediately and will review the case. If fraudulent activities are confirmed, Ember may terminate your account and report the incident to relevant authorities.
   - **Example 2**: If your account is used to distribute malware or conduct cyber-attacks, Ember will suspend access to your account and may seek legal action.

2. **Legal Action by Ember, Including Seeking Damages**:  
   Ember may pursue legal action in accordance with **Swedish Law** if you engage in activities that cause harm to the platform, other users, or Ember's business interests. This may include seeking compensatory damages for any financial or reputational loss incurred due to your actions.

   - **Example 1**: If your activities involve scraping sensitive data or infringing on intellectual property rights, Ember may pursue legal action to recover damages as outlined by the **Swedish Copyright Act** or **GDPR** regulations.
   - **Example 2**: In cases of fraudulent transactions or impersonation, Ember may seek legal recourse under **Swedish Penal Law** to press charges and claim damages.

3. **Notification of Law Enforcement Authorities**:  
   In cases where violations of this policy involve criminal activities, Ember reserves the right to report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement agencies. This includes violations of Swedish laws related to data theft, harassment, or fraud.

   - **Example 1**: If you are found to be impersonating a person with the intent to defraud or harm, Ember will notify Swedish authorities to investigate and take appropriate legal action.
   - **Example 2**: If there is evidence that a user is involved in spreading harmful malware or engaging in cyberattacks, Ember will immediately report this to Swedish police or relevant authorities to ensure compliance with national cybersecurity laws.

### **SECTION 8: PRIVACY POLICY AND DATA USAGE**  

#### 8.1 **Data Collection**  
Ember collects, processes, and stores personal data in accordance with its **Privacy Policy** and in compliance with Swedish law, particularly the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**. The data collected may include, but is not limited to:

1. **Account Information**:  
   Information provided during account registration, such as email address, username, password, and contact details.  
   
2. **Profile Information**:  
   Data users voluntarily provide in their profile, including personal preferences, relationship goals, hobbies, interests, photographs, and other content shared via the Platform.  
   
3. **Usage Data**:  
   Data about how you interact with the Platform, including browsing behavior, interactions with other users (messages, likes, etc.), and usage patterns such as session time, frequency of visits, and actions taken within the Platform. This data may be collected through cookies and similar technologies.  
   
4. **Device Information**:  
   Information about the devices used to access Ember, including the IP address, browser type, operating system, device model, location data, and other technical details related to device configurations.  

#### 8.2 **Use of Data**  
The data collected is used for the following purposes:

1. **Improving Matchmaking Algorithms**:  
   Data, including profile information and user interactions, is analyzed to improve the accuracy of the matchmaking system, enhancing user experience by delivering more relevant and personalized matches. This includes the use of machine learning algorithms that take into account your preferences and behaviors to suggest connections.  
   
2. **Sending Notifications, Updates, and Promotional Content**:  
   Ember may use your data to send you important updates, notifications, and marketing materials related to the Platform’s services, including new features, promotions, and events. You will be given the option to manage your preferences or opt-out of marketing communications in compliance with **Swedish Direct Marketing Laws** and the **GDPR**.  
   
3. **Ensuring Compliance with Local and International Laws**:  
   Data is processed to comply with **Swedish laws**, including the **Swedish Personal Data Act** and **GDPR** regulations, as well as international regulations where applicable. This may involve verifying that users comply with legal requirements, processing requests from law enforcement, or protecting Ember’s rights and obligations.  

4. **Enhancing Platform Security**:  
   Usage data, including device information, is used to monitor and protect the security of the Platform. This includes identifying and preventing fraudulent activity, unauthorized access attempts, and security breaches.  

#### 8.3 **Third-Party Sharing**  
Ember may share your data with trusted third-party providers for the following purposes:

1. **Payment Processing**:  
   When you make payments for subscription services, Ember shares relevant financial data with trusted third-party payment processors. These processors comply with **Swedish financial regulations** and **GDPR** to protect your payment details. Your payment information will not be stored by Ember but will be handled directly by payment service providers (e.g., PayPal, credit card processors).

2. **Analytics and Marketing**:  
   Ember may engage third-party vendors to conduct analytics and marketing campaigns to improve user engagement and the Platform’s overall performance. These vendors may receive aggregated, anonymized data to perform their tasks, but they are prohibited from using or sharing personal information for any other purpose.

   - **Example**: Ember may work with analytics companies like Google Analytics to understand user behavior on the Platform, but Google will not receive personally identifiable information without your explicit consent.

3. **Legal Compliance**:  
   Ember may disclose your data if required by law, such as in response to subpoenas, court orders, or requests from law enforcement. If legally compelled, Ember will disclose only the minimum amount of personal data necessary to comply with legal obligations. This disclosure is governed by **Swedish law** and **GDPR** provisions regarding legal obligations.

   - **Example**: If a user’s account is suspected of engaging in criminal activity, Ember may be required to provide relevant user data to Swedish authorities as part of an investigation, while ensuring compliance with the **Swedish Penal Code** and **GDPR** protections.

4. **Business Transfers**:  
   In the event that Ember undergoes a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your personal data may be transferred to the new entity. Ember will ensure that any such transfer complies with applicable privacy laws and that the new entity will protect your data according to the same standards set out in this Agreement.

#### 8.4 **Data Anonymization and Safeguards**  
Ember uses robust methods to ensure that your data is anonymized wherever possible. These procedures are designed to minimize the risks associated with the processing of personal data. Ember employs the following safeguards:

1. **Data Anonymization**:  
   When personal data is no longer needed for the purposes it was originally collected, it may be anonymized to prevent identification of individuals. Anonymized data may be retained for research, analytics, or improvement of the Platform, but it will not be used to identify any specific user.

2. **Pseudonymization**:  
   Ember may pseudonymize your data, replacing personally identifiable information with pseudonyms, ensuring that the data cannot be traced back to you without additional information stored separately. This allows Ember to process your data for certain purposes while maintaining your privacy.

3. **Encryption**:  
   Ember implements advanced encryption methods to protect your data during transmission and while stored in its systems. All sensitive data, such as passwords and financial information, is encrypted using industry-standard methods to prevent unauthorized access.

4. **Access Control**:  
   Access to personal data within Ember is restricted to authorized personnel only. Ember’s employees and third-party service providers who handle your data are required to follow strict privacy and security protocols to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse of your personal information.

5. **Data Minimization**:  
   Ember follows the principle of data minimization under **GDPR**, meaning it collects only the minimum amount of data necessary to provide services to you. This ensures that unnecessary or excessive data is not stored, reducing potential risks related to privacy and security.

#### 8.5 **User Rights and Controls**  
As a user, you have the following rights regarding your personal data:

1. **Right to Access**:  
   You have the right to request a copy of the personal data Ember holds about you. Ember will provide this information within one month, in accordance with the **GDPR**.

2. **Right to Rectification**:  
   You may request to correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data held by Ember.

3. **Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten)**:  
   You may request the deletion of your personal data, subject to certain legal exceptions, such as when Ember is required to retain data for legal purposes or when there are overriding legitimate grounds for processing.

4. **Right to Object to Processing**:  
   You may object to the processing of your personal data, particularly if the processing is based on legitimate interests or direct marketing.

5. **Right to Data Portability**:  
   You have the right to request that your personal data be provided to you in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, and to transfer that data to another service provider.

6. **Right to Withdraw Consent**:  
   You have the right to withdraw your consent to data processing at any time. If you withdraw consent, Ember will no longer process your data for the purposes for which consent was originally given, unless there is a lawful basis for continuing to process your data.

To exercise any of your rights, please contact Ember's data protection officer at [insert contact information] or through the contact options available on the Platform.

### **SECTION 9: PAYMENT TERMS (IF APPLICABLE)**  

#### 9.1 **Subscription Plans**  
Certain features and services of the Platform, including premium matchmaking, enhanced visibility, and additional communication tools, are only accessible through paid subscriptions. The specific details of available subscription plans, including their pricing, duration, features, and benefits, are provided within the Platform’s interface. Ember reserves the right to update or modify subscription plans and pricing at its discretion. Any changes to pricing or available features will be communicated to you in advance, and your continued use of the subscription services constitutes your agreement to any updated terms.

#### 9.2 **Payment Methods**  
Ember accepts various payment methods for your convenience, including:

1. **Credit and Debit Cards**:  
   You may use major credit cards, such as Visa, MasterCard, and American Express, to pay for subscription services. Payments are securely processed through third-party payment processors. Ember does not store your credit card details, ensuring that your payment information is handled securely by trusted vendors.  

2. **Third-Party Payment Gateways**:  
   Ember also accepts payments through third-party gateways such as PayPal and Stripe. These payment processors adhere to stringent security standards, and Ember does not store sensitive payment information.  

3. **Currency**:  
   Payments will be processed in the currency specified within the Platform. If your payment method operates in a different currency, conversion fees may apply, and Ember will not be responsible for such fees.

Ember utilizes secure encryption technologies to protect your payment data, complying with applicable data protection laws, including the **GDPR** and **Swedish Financial Regulations**.

#### 9.3 **Refund Policy**  
Refunds for subscription purchases are issued at Ember’s sole discretion. The following outlines the conditions under which you may request a refund:

1. **Eligibility for Refunds**:  
   Refund requests may be eligible if the following criteria are met:
   - The request is submitted within 14 days of purchase.
   - You have not used the service extensively (e.g., accessed premium features or communicated with other users).
   - The purchase was made in error or due to extenuating circumstances, such as technical issues that prevented access to the Platform.

2. **Refund Denial Scenarios**:  
   Refunds may be denied under the following circumstances:
   - The 14-day refund request window has passed.
   - You have already used the premium features for a substantial period of time (e.g., communicated with other users, viewed profiles).
   - The service was canceled or suspended due to a violation of the Terms of Service or **Acceptable Use Policy**.
   - The subscription was renewed automatically, and you failed to cancel the subscription before the renewal date.

   **Example 1**:  
   A user purchases a 3-month subscription but requests a refund 30 days after the purchase. Since the refund request is made after the 14-day window, the request is denied.  

   **Example 2**:  
   A user subscribes to a premium service, utilizes the full benefits (such as viewing and messaging other profiles), and then requests a refund citing dissatisfaction. The refund will be denied as the service was already used.  

3. **How to Request a Refund**:  
   If you believe you are eligible for a refund, you may request one by contacting Ember’s support team at [Support Email] within 14 days of your purchase. You will need to provide the following information:
   - Your account details (email address or username).
   - Proof of purchase (e.g., receipt or payment confirmation).
   - A detailed explanation of why you are requesting the refund.

4. **Exceptions**:  
   Refunds may not be granted if you:
   - Failed to access the Platform due to issues related to your own device, internet connection, or account information.
   - Requested a refund after using the service beyond a reasonable trial period or beyond what Ember deems to be "extensive use."

5. **Refund Processing**:  
   Once your refund request is approved, Ember will process the refund within 14 days of the approval date. Refunds will be issued through the original payment method (e.g., credit card, PayPal). Please note that depending on your payment method, it may take additional time for the funds to appear in your account.

**Example**:  
A user requests a refund due to technical issues accessing the Platform. Upon investigation, Ember determines the issue was related to the user’s browser settings rather than a Platform error. In this case, the refund request would be denied as it does not meet the criteria for extenuating circumstances.

#### 9.4 **Subscription Cancellations and Renewals**  
1. **Cancellation**:  
   You may cancel your subscription at any time through the Platform’s settings. Cancellations will take effect at the end of the current billing period, and you will retain access to the premium features until the end of that period. No partial refunds will be issued for unused portions of the subscription.

2. **Automatic Renewal**:  
   If you have subscribed to a recurring subscription plan, your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle unless you cancel before the renewal date. You will be notified via email prior to the renewal to remind you of the upcoming charge. If you do not wish to continue the subscription, you must cancel before the renewal date.

   **Example**:  
   A user has a monthly subscription plan that is set to renew on the 1st of each month. Ember sends a reminder email on the 28th of the month. If the user does not cancel before the 1st, the subscription will automatically renew for the next month.

3. **Subscription Upgrades and Downgrades**:  
   Users may upgrade or downgrade their subscription plans at any time. Any upgrade will take effect immediately, and the new payment will be prorated for the remaining time in the current billing cycle. Downgrades will take effect at the start of the next billing cycle.

#### 9.5 **Taxes**  
Prices listed for subscription plans do not include applicable taxes, duties, or levies that may be required by law. You are responsible for paying any such taxes, which will be added to the subscription price at the time of payment.

### **SECTION 10: WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMERS**

#### 10.1 Platform Availability  
The Platform is provided on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis. Ember makes no guarantee regarding the uptime, availability, or error-free operation of the Platform. Ember reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any portion of the Platform, and any such actions may occur with or without notice. Ember is not liable for any downtime, disruptions, or interruptions in service, whether caused by technical issues, maintenance, or unforeseen events.

#### 10.2 Limitation of Warranties  
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Ember disclaims all warranties, including but not limited to:  
1. Fitness for a particular purpose;  
2. Non-infringement of intellectual property rights;  
3. Compatibility with specific devices or operating systems;  
4. Accuracy, reliability, or completeness of any information or content on the Platform.

Ember does not warrant that the Platform will meet all user expectations or be free from errors, defects, or security vulnerabilities. Users are solely responsible for their use of the Platform and for taking appropriate precautions to avoid data loss, system disruptions, and other risks.

#### 10.3 Data Loss  
Ember does not guarantee the retention or security of any data uploaded, entered, or stored on the Platform. In the event of a system failure, data corruption, or unauthorized access, Ember shall not be held liable for any loss, damage, or unauthorized disclosure of user data. Users are encouraged to regularly back up any important data stored on the Platform.

#### 10.4 Third-Party Service Disruptions  
The Platform may rely on third-party services (e.g., payment gateways, cloud storage, API providers, etc.) to operate. Ember makes no warranties regarding the availability, reliability, or functionality of these third-party services. In the event of disruptions, failures, or interruptions in third-party services, Ember shall not be held responsible for any consequences or damages that may result.

#### 10.5 Acts of God  
Ember shall not be held liable for any failure or delay in providing services caused by circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to natural disasters, power outages, wars, civil unrest, government actions, or other unforeseen events (commonly referred to as "Acts of God"). Ember shall make reasonable efforts to restore service as soon as possible under such conditions, but cannot guarantee service continuity or compensation for losses caused by such events. 

### **SECTION 11: LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**  

#### 11.1 General Limitation  
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Ember and its affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, and service providers shall not be liable for:  
1. Any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages;  
   *Example*: A user experiences a technical issue with the Ember platform that causes their messages to be delayed by several hours. While the platform eventually resolves the issue, the user loses a potential match due to the delayed communication. The user cannot claim indirect damages (such as emotional distress or lost relationships) as a result of the delay, because the platform’s liability is limited to direct damages.  
2. Loss of profits, revenue, data, or goodwill;  
   *Example*: A business client uses Ember’s paid features to advertise their dating service and relies on it to generate leads. The platform experiences a temporary outage that results in the client losing potential leads for one day. Ember would not be liable for the client’s lost revenue or business opportunities, as the agreement limits liability to direct damages.  
3. Damages resulting from unauthorized access to, use of, or alteration of Your transmissions or content.  
   *Example*: A hacker breaches the platform’s security and alters some user profiles. The user experiences embarrassment but does not suffer any financial harm. Under this clause, Ember would not be responsible for any emotional distress, as the agreement excludes liability for indirect or consequential damages resulting from unauthorized access.

#### 11.2 Cap on Liability  
Ember’s total liability to You for any claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or Your use of the Platform is limited to the greater of:  
a. The amount You paid, if any, for access to the Platform during the twelve (12) months preceding the claim; or  
b. One hundred U.S. dollars ($100).  
   *Example 1*: A user subscribes to Ember's premium service for $50 per year. Due to a technical glitch, they are unable to access their account for two days. The user claims that this breach caused them significant inconvenience, but their total claim is limited to $50, the amount they paid for access to the platform in the preceding year.  
   *Example 2*: A user who has not paid for any services on Ember’s platform attempts to claim damages for a loss of access to their account. Since the user did not make any payments, their claim is capped at $100, as outlined in the agreement, even if they believe the inconvenience caused a higher financial loss.

#### 11.3 Exclusions  
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages. In such cases, Ember’s liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.  
   *Example 1*: A user in a jurisdiction where the exclusion of consequential damages is prohibited (such as California) sues Ember for indirect damages resulting from a data breach. Since the jurisdiction does not allow the exclusion of such damages, Ember's liability would not be limited, and they would have to pay for the consequential damages as determined by local law.  
   *Example 2*: A user in the European Union tries to sue Ember for loss of goodwill after their account was wrongfully suspended. Under the European Union’s consumer protection laws, Ember cannot exclude all liability, so the damages may be determined based on the specific legal framework of the EU, which may impose stricter regulations than those outlined in the agreement.

### **SECTION 12: INDEMNIFICATION**  

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Ember, its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, and service providers from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from:  
1. Your violation of this Agreement;  
2. Your misuse of the Platform;  
3. Your violation of any third-party rights, including intellectual property rights or privacy rights; or  
4. Any content You submit or actions You perform on the Platform.  

#### 12.1 Notification of Claims  
In the event of a claim, Ember will notify You in writing and may:  
1. Allow You to assume control of the defense at Your expense; or  
2. Participate in the defense at Ember’s discretion, retaining its own legal counsel.  

#### 12.2 Procedural Steps for Resolving Indemnification Claims  
1. **Claim Notification**:  
   Upon receiving a claim or notice of a legal proceeding against Ember for which You are required to indemnify, Ember will promptly notify You in writing. The notice will include a summary of the claim and the nature of the allegations.

2. **Initial Response**:  
   Within [X] business days of receiving notice of a claim, You must provide Ember with an acknowledgment of receipt and indicate whether You intend to assume control of the defense. If You fail to respond within the specified period, Ember may assume control of the defense at its discretion.

3. **Assumption of Defense**:  
   If You choose to assume control of the defense, You must retain legal counsel reasonably acceptable to Ember. Ember has the right to participate in the defense at its own expense, but it will not control the proceedings. Ember may also opt to assume control of the defense if it believes Your defense is not adequate.

4. **Cooperation**:  
   You agree to cooperate fully with Ember and its legal counsel in defending the claim. This includes providing any documents or information necessary for Ember's defense and allowing access to relevant personnel for depositions or testimony if needed.

5. **Settlement**:  
   You may not settle any claim in a way that adversely affects Ember without Ember's prior written consent. Ember has the right to settle any claim at its discretion, including those where You are defending the claim, provided that Ember pays the settlement amount and assumes responsibility for the damages.

6. **Expenses**:  
   You are responsible for paying all reasonable costs and expenses incurred in defending the claim, including attorneys' fees, whether or not the claim is successful. Ember may, at its discretion, advance these costs and expenses to You, which You must reimburse within [X] days of a request for reimbursement.

7. **Final Resolution**:  
   Once the claim is resolved, either through settlement or judgment, Ember will notify You of the final outcome. You will be responsible for any damages or fees arising from the claim that Ember incurs due to Your actions.

8. **Exclusions**:  
   If the claim results from Ember's own negligence, fraud, or other wrongful conduct, Ember will not be entitled to indemnification from You for those specific damages.

### **SECTION 13: TERMINATION OF SERVICE**  

#### 13.1 Grounds for Termination  
Ember may terminate or suspend Your access to the Platform, with or without notice, for reasons that include but are not limited to:  
1. Violations of this Agreement;  
2. Fraudulent activities or impersonation of other Users;  
3. Complaints or reports from other Users regarding Your behavior; or  
4. Technical, security, or legal issues.  

#### 13.2 User-Initiated Termination  
You may terminate Your account at any time by:  
1. Navigating to the “Account Settings” section of the Platform;  
2. Selecting “Delete Account”; and  
3. Following the confirmation procedures.  

#### 13.3 Effect of Termination  
Upon termination, all rights granted to You under this Agreement will immediately cease. Ember reserves the right to:  
1. Retain anonymized data for analytical purposes;  
2. Retain content or interactions necessary for compliance with legal obligations; and  
3. Deny future account registrations at its sole discretion.  

#### 13.4 Handling of Remaining Subscription Periods or Refunds  
1. **Subscription Termination by User**:  
   If You choose to terminate Your account during a paid subscription period, Your subscription will remain active until the end of the current billing cycle. You will not be entitled to a refund for the remaining period, unless required by applicable law or at Ember’s discretion based on specific circumstances.

2. **Subscription Termination by Ember**:  
   If Ember terminates Your account or access due to violations of this Agreement, fraudulent activities, or any other reason under Section 13.1, You will not be entitled to a refund for any unused portion of a paid subscription.

3. **Refund Process**:  
   In cases where You are eligible for a refund, the refund will be processed using the original method of payment. Refund requests should be submitted within [X] days of the termination or suspension. Ember will process eligible refunds within [Y] days, depending on the method of payment.

4. **Outstanding Fees**:  
   Upon termination, You are still liable for any outstanding fees or charges incurred prior to the termination date. Ember reserves the right to collect any unpaid fees through appropriate means, including using a collection agency if necessary.

Here’s the expanded version of **Section 14: Governing Law and Jurisdiction**, including examples of how conflicts between jurisdictions might be resolved and reiterating arbitration requirements:

---

### **SECTION 14: GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION**  

#### 14.1 Choice of Law  
This Agreement is governed by the laws of [Your Jurisdiction], excluding its conflict of law principles.  

#### 14.2 Venue  
Any disputes arising under this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in [Your Jurisdiction].  

#### 14.3 International Use  
Users accessing the Platform from outside [Your Jurisdiction] are responsible for ensuring compliance with local laws. Ember makes no representation that the Platform is appropriate or available for use in all locations.  

#### 14.4 Conflicts Between Jurisdictions  
In the event of a conflict between the laws of [Your Jurisdiction] and the local laws of a user’s country, the following procedures will apply:  
1. **Conflict Resolution by Negotiation**:  
   If a dispute arises regarding the applicability of the governing law or jurisdiction, both parties agree to attempt to resolve the dispute through informal negotiations. This may include engaging in discussions or mediation to reach an agreement without formal legal action.

2. **Resolution through Arbitration**:  
   If the dispute cannot be resolved through informal negotiations, both parties agree to submit the matter to binding arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted in [Your Jurisdiction] under the rules of the [Arbitration Association or Institution], which shall govern the arbitration process. The decision of the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding. The party initiating the arbitration shall bear the costs of the arbitration, unless otherwise determined by the arbitrator(s).

3. **Compliance with Local Laws**:  
   In cases where users from different jurisdictions are involved, and local laws may impose restrictions on the arbitration or governing law provisions, Ember agrees to comply with those legal obligations as required. For example, if a user in the European Union has a dispute, they may have certain rights under EU law that override the choice of law and jurisdiction provisions in this Agreement, especially regarding consumer protection rights.

4. **Forum Non Conveniens**:  
   If a user contests the jurisdiction or venue under this Agreement due to significant inconvenience, the court may consider a motion for a change of venue (forum non conveniens). The court will decide whether the case should proceed in a more convenient jurisdiction based on the location of the parties, the nature of the dispute, and other factors such as the costs and fairness of litigation in the chosen jurisdiction.

#### 14.5 Arbitration Requirements  
In addition to the provisions mentioned above, all disputes and claims related to this Agreement shall be resolved through binding arbitration, except where prohibited by law. The following rules apply to arbitration:  
1. **Arbitration Scope**:  
   Arbitration will apply to all disputes, including claims related to the validity of this Agreement, breach, or enforcement of terms, except for claims related to intellectual property infringement or claims that cannot be arbitrated under applicable law.
   
2. **Arbitration Process**:  
   The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the [Arbitration Association or Institution], with the location of the arbitration determined by the applicable jurisdiction rules, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.
   
3. **Arbitration Fees**:  
   You will be responsible for all legal fees and costs, but Ember will bear the cost of the arbitration itself, except in cases where the arbitrator determines that the dispute was frivolous or brought in bad faith.

4. **No Class Action**:  
   You agree that any arbitration will be conducted on an individual basis only, and not as part of a class action or other representative proceeding. 

### **SECTION 15: DISPUTE RESOLUTION**  

#### 15.1 Mandatory Arbitration  
All disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be resolved through binding arbitration conducted under the rules of the [Arbitration Body], located in [City].  

#### 15.2 Arbitration Procedure  
1. A written demand for arbitration must be submitted within thirty (30) days of the dispute.  
2. Each party shall bear its own costs for arbitration, including legal fees, unless otherwise awarded by the arbitrator.  
3. Arbitration decisions are final and binding, with limited rights to appeal.
